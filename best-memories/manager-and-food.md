I'm a software engineer. During the time Mikeal was my manager, I was able to focus on the work I felt was the most important one to do.

He shielded me from the things that were going on at higher levels. Especially for performance reviews, I only had to participate in bare minimum of the process, he did the rest and always to the best interest of me.

I know that he had battles fighting if favour of me. Thank you so much, that it was such a smooth experience for me.

And of course thanks for all the great food we had whenever we were somewhere anywhere in the world. It's always a safe bet to just follow your lead (oh, that dumplings place in Berlin).
