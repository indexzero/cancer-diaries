We met early in my career when the company where I worked invited you to
speak ([Join us June 14th for Episode 6 : Mikeal Rogers - 3 talks in 1!](https://www.tumblr.com/techtalksto-blog/5865019181/join-us-june-14th-for-episode-6-mikeal-rogers)).

We went out as a group after the talk, but as the evening was
winding down I invited you to the fancy-pants [BarChef](https://www.barchef.com/) for a nightcap.

I forget exactly what we talked about, but I remember being starstruck. Here I
was meeting the creator of a popular open-source library for the JavaScript
runtime I'd recently become obsessed with.

As starstruck as I was, it was cool to see that open-source was done by real
human beings, and that those human beings would be willing to take the time to talk
with a green software developer like myself.

I think this was one of the interactions that helped give me the confidence to
contribute to open-source, setting me on a path to moving to San
Francisco and, eventually, working at npm...

While at npm, I saw you in your element building community.

You planned conferences like NodeConf, which included boogey barns and swimming
holes ... this helped the early Node.js community feel more like a family (_in
a good way, not a gross 'this company is a family' way_). These events helped
build friendships I have until this day, with folks like
[Ryan Day](https://github.com/soldair) and [Myles Borins](https://github.com/mylesborins).

You were instrumental to the success of
[io.js](https://github.com/nodejs/iojs.org), handing Node.js' destiny  to its
maintainers. I remember joining for lunches where you and
[Isaac](https://github.com/isaacs) played 3D space-chess. It was cool to feel
like I _literallly_ had a seat at the table.

You supported me when I tried to throw my own, sometimes ill-advised ðŸ˜›,
community events like
[Dance.js](https://x.com/BenjaminCoe/status/729705915285262337).

I wanted to share that you were an important figure at this important period
in my life (_the weird and wonderful npm years_). 
I look up to you, respect you, and am still a little bit starstruck.
