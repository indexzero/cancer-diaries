In many ways my time in Oakland, up to about 2013 (?) or so, feels so deeply intertwined with knowing you socially that this is going to be less about one specific memory and maybe more of a brain dump of Mikeal memories in general. Joanne was asking how we all met and I'm pretty sure Lane Ford introduced us. Or maybe Keli Rivers. It was definitely at Flora though. I think you introduced me to Ben Runkle, which is how I ended up with a commercial fridge in my basement but that is different story for another day. 

The tip from [this post](https://github.com/mikeal/cancer-diaries/blob/main/best-memories/a-christmas-miracle.md#a-christmas-miracle) had me checking Twitter DMs and sure enough, our first messages on there are about Flora and Stumptown coffee, which totally tracks.

You were at both pig roasts at my house, which is maybe how we came up with the idea to run a pop-up restaurant at that house. I still have some of the wine glasses you bought for that. They have held up across multiple intra- and inter-state moves, and every time I pull one out I think of you. I can't rightly remember why we didn't do that again.

I remember you convinced me my landlord wouldn't get mad if you used his miter saw in my basement to chop some table legs, which he totally was.

I still have a Tacoconf sticker somewhere. Tacoconf is very high on my list of the most Oakland memories of Oakland. That felt like that sort of thing that could only have happened there, and then. 

I was always bummed that we fell out of touch and also kept telling myself that I'd catch up with you sometime when I had a second. I'm sad this is what it took to move the needle.
