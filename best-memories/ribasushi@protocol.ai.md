Not a great memory for me, but it ended well.

A long time ago, on a continent far far away 🇩🇪 I decide I am way too bored slinging 🇺🇸 real-estate appraisals (true story). I quit that rather stable job and jump on an opportunity to join an eclectic mix of folks doing things I do not fully understand. Things are looking good in the world, and a contract-to-hire gamble doesn't sound that risky. The day is December 2nd 2019.

Fast forward a few months: the day is June 1st 2020. With literally zero warning, out of the blue I am informed that my contract is to end in couple weeks, because "it is not working out". Much later I learned about "few" structural problems that led to the surprised pikachu, but at the time the walls decisively closed on me. My partner and I were corona-trapped in a one-bedroom apartment; infection numbers were shooting up and a second wave of lockdowns was clearly coming; economic pundits with nothing better to do were indulging in economic-disaster-porn; and now I was freshly unemployed.

I never really got to ask you what did it take to rehire me virtually on the spot. Nor why did you do it. But whatever the effort on your end, it pales with how much this meant for me. It is hard to overstate how precarious my situation was mentally, situationally and financially. You saved me in more ways than one. I hope I managed to do right by you in the years since.

Thank you 🙇‍♂️
